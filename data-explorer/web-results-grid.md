## Azure Data Explorer web UI results grid

This document will highlight how to use the results grid to customize your Azure Data Explorer web UI results and do further analysis.

### Expand a cell

Expanding cells are useful to view long strings or dynamic fields such as JSON.

1. Double-click a cell to open an expanded view. This view allows you to read long strings, and provides a JSON formatting for dynamic data.

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/expand-cell.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Data Explorer web U I expanded cell to show long strings.":::

1. Select on the icon on the top right of the result grid to switch reading pane modes. Choose between the following reading pane modes for expanded view: inline, below pane, and right pane.

### Expand a row

When working with a table with dozens of columns, expand the entire row to be able to easily see an overview of the different columns and their content.

1. Click on the arrow **>** to the left of the row you want to expand.

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/expand-row.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an expanded row in the Azure Data Explorer web UI.":::

1. Within the expanded row, some columns are expanded (arrow pointing down), and some columns are collapsed (arrow pointing right). Click on these arrows to toggle between these two modes.

### Group column by results

Within the results, you can group results by any column.

1. Run the following query:

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | sort by StartTime desc
    | take 10
    ```

1. Mouse-over the **State** column, select the menu, and select **Group by State**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/group-by.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a table with query results grouped by state.":::

1. In the grid, double-click on **California** to expand and see records for that state. This type of grouping can be helpful when doing exploratory analysis.

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/group-expanded.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a query results grid with California group expanded in the Azure Data Explorer web U I." border="false":::

1. Mouse-over the **Group** column, then select **Reset columns**. This setting returns the grid to its original state.

#### Use value aggregation

After you've grouped by a column, you can then use the value aggregation function to calculate simple statistics per group.

1. Select the menu for the column you want to evaluate.
1. Select **Value Aggregation**, and then select the type of function you want to do on this column.

### Hide empty columns

You can hide/unhide empty columns by toggling the **eye** icon on the results grid menu.

### Filter columns

You can use one or more operators to filter the results of a column.

1. To filter a specific column, select the menu for that column.
1. Select the filter icon.
1. In the filter builder, select the desired operator.
1. Type in the expression you wish to filter the column on. Results are filtered as you type.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The filter isn't case sensitive.

1. To create a multi-condition filter, select a boolean operator to add another condition
1. To remove the filter, delete the text from your first filter condition.

### Run cell statistics

1. Run the following query.

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | sort by StartTime desc
    | where DamageProperty > 5000
    | project StartTime, State, EventType, DamageProperty, Source
    | take 10
    ```

1. In the results grid, select a few of the numerical cells. The table grid allows you to select multiple rows, columns, and cells and calculate aggregations on them. The Azure Data Explorer web UI currently supports the following functions for numeric values: **Average**, **Count**, **Min**, **Max**, and **Sum**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/select-stats.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a table with selected functions.":::

### Filter to query from grid

Another easy way to filter the grid is to add a filter operator to the query directly from the grid.

1. Select a cell with content you wish to create a query filter for.

1. Right-click to open the cell actions menu. Select **Add selection as filter**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/add-selection-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a dropdown menu with the Add selection as filter option to query directly from the grid.":::

1. A query clause will be added to your query in the query editor:

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/add-query-from-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the query editor showing query clause added from filtering on the grid in Azure Data Explorer web U I.":::

### Pivot

The pivot mode feature is similar to Excelâ€™s pivot table, enabling you to do advanced analysis in the grid itself.

Pivoting allows you to take a columns value and turn them into columns. For example, you can pivot on *State* to make columns for Florida, Missouri, Alabama, and so on.

1. On the right side of the grid, select **Columns** to see the table tool panel.

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/tool-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to access the pivot mode feature.":::

1. Select **Pivot Mode**, then drag columns as follows: **EventType** to **Row groups**; **DamageProperty** to **Values**; and **State** to **Column labels**.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/pivot-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting selected column names to create the pivot table.":::

    The result should look like the following pivot table:

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/pivot-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results in a pivot table.":::

### Search in the results grid

You can look for a specific expression within a result table.

1. Run the following query:

    ```Kusto
    StormEvents
    | where DamageProperty > 5000
    | take 1000
    ```

1. Click on the **Search** button on the right and type in *"Wabash"*

    :::image type="content" source="media/web-query-data/search.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the search bar in the table.":::

1. All mentions of your searched expression are now highlighted in the table. You can navigate between them by clicking *Enter* to go forward or *Shift+Enter* to go backward, or you can use the *up* and *down* buttons next to the search box.
