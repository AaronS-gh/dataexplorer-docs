# Azure Data Explorer web UI overview

Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. The Azure Data Explorer [web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com) is a web application that provides an end to end experience of Azure Data Explorer, including streamlined processes to ingest data, query using Kusto Query Language (KQL), and view dashboard visualizations. You can start by accessing the free sample data available from the web UI, or by [ingesting](ingest-data-overview.md) your own data.

The following image shows the Azure Data Explorer web UI **Home** page and navigation pane for accessing the core elements of the web UI.

## Experience data exploration using the Azure Data Explorer web UI

Use the navigation pane to guide your data analytics journey.

- Get started quickly with the [**Home** page](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/home), which provides free and immediate access to the **help** cluster and the [samples gallery](web-ui-samples-gallery.md), complete with sample data, query tutorials, and built in dashboards. From the **Home** page, you can also easily create a [free cluster](start-for-free.md) or connect to your own clusters. To help you on your journey, check out additional information including **Recommended** reading and basic and advanced **Documentation**.
- In the **Data** tab, explore the [**Data Management**](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/oneclick) page, to ingest and organize data. The [one click ingestion](ingest-data-one-click.md) wizard makes data ingestion fast and intuitive.
- Once you've ingested either your own data or accessed the **help** cluster, check out the **Query** tab to open the [query editor window](https://dataexplorer.azure.com). From here you can [write](write-queries.md) and run your own KQL commands and queries, or learn from descriptive tutorials in the [samples gallery](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help) to help you get started.
- [**Dashboards**](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/dashboards) allow you to [visualize](azure-data-explorer-dashboards.md) and explore either your own data or built in dashboards from the samples gallery.
- [**MyCluster**](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/freecluster) allows you to explore the capabilities of Azure Data Explorer for free [using](start-for-free-web-ui.md) your own data.
