# Get latest versions of Azure Cosmos DB documents (Preview)

In this article, you'll learn how to get the latest version of ingested documents.

## Get the latest versions of documents

Every time a document update is ingested from the change feed, a new row is added in the target table. Over time, the table builds up a history of every document in the corresponding Cosmos DB container. A typical requirement is to query the latest version of a document, corresponds to getting the *current state* of the Cosmos DB container.

You can use the following ways to query the *current state* from your table:

- [Run a query to get the latest versions of documents](#run-a-query-to-get-the-latest-versions-of-documents)
- [Create a materialized view of the latest versions of documents](#create-a-materialized-view-of-the-latest-versions-of-documents)

In the examples, you'll get the latest versions of document by summarizing the table by the **Id** column, using the [arg_max](kusto/query/arg-max-aggfunction.md) function on the **_ts** column to only show the rows with the most recent timestamps.

### Run a query to get the latest versions of documents

Run the following query to get the latest versions of documents:

```kusto
TestTable
| summarize arg_max(_ts, *) by Id
```

If you used soft markers to mark deleted documents, you can filter them out with the following query:

```kusto
TestTable
| summarize arg_max(_ts, *) by Id
| where not(IsDeleted)
```

### Create a materialized view of the latest versions of documents

If your table has a lot of updates, the query to get the latest versions of documents can be slow. [materialized views](kusto/management/materialized-views/materialized-view-overview.md) usually have better performance than a query if there are a lot of updates.

Run the following command to create a materialized view of the latest versions of documents:

```kusto
.create materialized-view LatestDocuments on table TestTable
{
    CosmosChangeFeed1
    | summarize arg_max(_ts, *) by Id
}
```

In a materialized view, you can't filter our soft markers as part of its query. Therefore, to remove deleted documents indicated by soft markers, query the materialized view and filter the results, as follows:

```kusto
LatestDocuments
| where not(IsDeleted)
```

Optionally, encapsulate the filtered query in a [stored function](kusto/query/schema-entities/stored-functions.md) and call it to get the latest filtered results, as follows:

```kusto
.create function LatestDocumentsDeletedRemoved(){
    LatestDocuments
    | where not(IsDeleted)
}

LatestDocumentsDeletedRemoved
| summarize sum(Salary) by Area
```
