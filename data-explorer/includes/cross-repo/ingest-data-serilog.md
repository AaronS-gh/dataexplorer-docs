Serilog is a popular logging framework for .NET applications. Serilog allows developers to control which log statements are output with arbitrary granularity based on the logger's name, logger level, and message pattern. The Serilog sink, also known as an appender, streams your log data to your KQL table, where you can analyze and visualize your logs in real time.

This article shows how to ingest data with Serilog.
