## IP-prefix notation

IP-prefix notation is a way of writing an IP address that includes a netmask. To use IP-prefix notation, write the base IP address followed by a slash (`/`) and an integer between 0 and 32. This integer represents the number of contiguous 1 bits in the netmask.

For example, the IP-prefix notation 192.168.2.0/24 would have a netmask with 24 contiguous 1 bits, or a netmask of 255.255.255.0 in dotted decimal format.
