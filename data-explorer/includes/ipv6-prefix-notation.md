## IP-prefix notation

IP-prefix notation is a way of writing an IP address that includes a netmask. To use IP-prefix notation, write the base IP address followed by a slash (`/`) and an integer between 0 and 128. This integer represents the number of contiguous 1 bits in the netmask.

For example, the IP-prefix notation fe80::85d:e82c:9446:7994/120 would have a netmask with 120 contiguous 1 bits.
