# Use wizard for one-time ingestion of historical data with LightIngest (preview)

LightIngest is a command-line utility for ad-hoc data ingestion into Azure Data Explorer.
To learn more about LightIngest, see [Use LightIngest to ingest data into Azure Data Explorer](lightingest.md).

LightIngest can be particularly useful to load historical data from an existing storage system to Azure Data Explorer. While you can build your own command using the list of [Command-line arguments](lightingest.md#command-line-arguments), this article shows you how to auto-generate this command through an ingestion wizard. In addition to creating the command, you can use this process to create a new table, and create schema mapping. This tool infers schema mapping from your data set.

This article shows you how to create a new table, create schema mapping, and generate a LightIngest command for one-time ingestion using the LightIngest tool.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* [A cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md).
* [A storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal).
* LightIngest - download it as part of the [Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Tools NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Tools/). For installation instructions, see [Install LightIngest](lightingest.md#install-lightingest).

## Access the wizard

The wizard can be accessed either from the **Data** tab, or from the **Query** tab of the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/).

1. In the **Data** tab, from the **Quick actions** section, select **Ingest new data**. Alternatively, from the **All actions** section, select **Ingest new data** and then **Ingest**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-existing-table/ingest-new-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot for the Azure Data Explorer web UI where you select one-click ingestion for a table.":::

1. In the **Query tab**, right-click a *database* and select **Ingest new data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/ingest-new-data-database-menu.png" alt-text="Ingest new data.":::

In the **Ingest new data** window, the **Destination** tab is selected. The **Cluster** and **Database** fields are automatically populated.

## Destination tab

1. In **Table**, check either **Existing table** or **Create new table**. When creating a new table, enter a name for the new table. You can use alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores. Special characters aren't supported.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Table names must be between 1 and 1024 characters.

    :::image type="content" source="media/generate-lightingest-command/ingest-new-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Data Explorer web UI with Data tab selected on the left menu, and Ingest new data dialog open to the right.":::

1. Select **Next: Source**

## Source tab

:::image type="content" source="media/generate-lightingest-command/source-tab-lightingest.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Source tab in Ingest new table window. ":::

  1. Under **Source type**, select **From blob container** (blob container, ADLS Gen2 container).
  1. Select **Ingestion type**>**Historical data**.
  1. You can either **Add URL** manually by copying the Account Key/SAS URL to source, or **Select container** from your storage account.
      > [!NOTE]
      > The SAS URL can be created [manually](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs#get-the-sas-for-a-blob-container) or [automatically](kusto/api/connection-strings/storage-connection-strings.md).
  1. When selecting from your storage account, select your **Storage subscription**, **Storage account**, and **Container** from the dropdown menus.

:::image type="content" source="media/generate-lightingest-command/source-tab-container-from-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dialog box for selecting container from storage subscription and account.":::

## Advanced settings

1. To define additional settings for the ingestion process using LightIngest, select **Advanced settings**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/generate-lightingest-command/source-tab-advanced-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting advanced settings for the ingestion processing involving the tool LightIngest.":::

1. In the **Advanced configuration** panel, define the following settings:

    :::image type="content" source="media/generate-lightingest-command/advanced-configuration-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting advanced options for the ingestion processing involving the tool LightIngest.":::

    | Property | Description|
    |---|---|
    | Creation time pattern | Specify to override the ingestion time property of the created extent with a pattern, for example, to apply a date based on the folder structure of the container. See also [Creation time pattern](lightingest.md#how-to-ingest-data-using-creationtime). |
    | Blob name pattern | Specify the pattern used to identify the files to be ingested. Ingest all the files that match the blob name pattern in the given container. Supports wildcards. Recommended to enclose in double quotes. |
    | Tag | A [tag](kusto/management/extents-overview.md#extent-tagging) assigned to the ingested data. The tag can be any string. |
    | Limit amount of files | Specify the number of files that can be ingested. Ingests the first `n` files that match the blob name pattern, up to the number specified.  |
    | Don't wait for ingestion to complete | If set, queues the blobs for ingestion without monitoring the ingestion process. If not set, LightIngest continues to poll the ingestion status until ingestion is complete.|
    | Display only selected items| List the files in the container, but doesn't ingest them.  |

1. Enter values for relevant fields and select **Done** to return to the **Source** tab.

## Filter data

If you want to, filter the data to ingest only files in a specific folder path or with a particular file extension.

:::image type="content" source="media/generate-lightingest-command/filter-data-lightingest.png" alt-text="Screenshot of filtering data in the source tab of the Ingest new data screen.":::

The system will select one of the files at random and the schema will be generated based on that  **Schema defining file**. You can select a different file.

Select **Next: Schema** to view and edit your table column configuration.

## Edit the schema

In the **Schema** tab:

1. By looking at the name of the source, the service automatically identifies if it's compressed or not. Confirm that the **Compression type** is correct.
1. Confirm the format selected in **Data format**:

     In this case, the data format is **CSV**

1. On tabular data, you can select the check box **Ignore the first record** to ignore the heading row of the file.
1. In the **Mapping name** field, enter a mapping name. You can use alphanumeric characters and underscores. Spaces, special characters, and hyphens aren't supported.

    When using an existing table, you can **Keep current table schema** if the table schema matches the selected format.

:::image type="content" source="media/generate-lightingest-command/schema-tab-lightingest.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the schema tab in the Ingest new data dialog in Azure Data Explorer web UI.":::

### Edit the table

When ingesting to a new table, alter various aspects of the table when creating the table.

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-one-click-column-table](includes/data-explorer-one-click-column-table.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> For tabular formats, you can't map a column twice. To map to an existing column, first delete the new column.

Select **Next: Summary** to generate the LightIngest command.

## Generate the LightIngest command

In the **Data ingestion completed** window, all three steps will be marked with green check marks.

Copy the generated LightIngest command by clicking on the **copy** icon to the top right of the command box.

In the tiles below the ingestion progress, you can download the LightIngest tool.

You can copy the command using the copy icon above the generated command box." lightbox="media/generate-lightingest-command/summary-tab-copy-command.png":::

To complete the ingestion process, you must [run LightIngest](lightingest.md#run-lightingest) using this copied command.
