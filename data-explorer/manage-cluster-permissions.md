# Manage Azure Data Explorer cluster permissions

Azure Data Explorer enables you to control access to resources in your cluster using a role-based access control model. Under this model, [principals](kusto/management/access-control/principals-and-identity-providers.md)—users, groups, and apps—are mapped to [security roles](kusto/management/security-roles.md). Principals are granted access to cluster resources according to the roles they're assigned.

This article describes the available cluster level roles and how to assign principals to those roles using the Azure portal.

## Cluster level permissions

|Role |Permissions |
|---|---|
|`AllDatabasesAdmin` | Full access in the scope of any database. May show and alter certain cluster-level policies. Includes all lower level `All Databases` permissions. |
|`AllDatabasesViewer` | Read all data and metadata of any database. |
|`AllDatabasesMonitor` | Execute `.show` commands in the context of any database and its child entities. |

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to your Azure Data Explorer cluster.

1. In the left-hand menu, under **Security + networking**, select **Permissions**.
