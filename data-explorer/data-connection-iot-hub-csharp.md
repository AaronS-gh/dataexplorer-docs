In this article, you create an IoT Hub data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using C#.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Turn on **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.
* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Access to an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. If necessary, create [a cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md).
* [Table and column mapping](./net-sdk-ingest-data.md#create-a-table-on-your-test-cluster).
* An [IoT Hub](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#create-an-iot-hub) with a shared access policy configured.

## Add an IoT Hub data connection

The following example shows you how to add an IoT Hub data connection programmatically. See [connect Azure Data Explorer table to IoT Hub](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#connect-azure-data-explorer-table-to-iot-hub) for adding an Iot Hub data connection using the Azure portal.

```csharp
var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Directory (tenant) ID
var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Application ID
var clientSecret = "PlaceholderClientSecret";//Client Secret
var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}");
var credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);
var result = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource: "https://management.core.windows.net/", clientCredential: credential);

var credentials = new TokenCredentials(result.AccessToken, result.AccessTokenType);

var kustoManagementClient = new KustoManagementClient(credentials)
{
    SubscriptionId = subscriptionId
};

var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
//The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
var databaseName = "mykustodatabase";
var dataConnectionName = "myeventhubconnect";
//The IoT hub that is created as part of the Prerequisites
var iotHubResourceId = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/xxxxxx";
var sharedAccessPolicyName = "iothubforread";
var consumerGroup = "$Default";
var location = "Central US";
//The table and column mapping are created as part of the Prerequisites
var tableName = "StormEvents";
var mappingRuleName = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping";
var dataFormat = DataFormat.CSV;
var databaseRouting = "Multi";

await kustoManagementClient.DataConnections.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroupName, clusterName, databaseName, dataConnectionName,
            new IotHubDataConnection(iotHubResourceId, consumerGroup, sharedAccessPolicyName, tableName: tableName, location: location, mappingRuleName: mappingRuleName, dataFormat: dataFormat, databaseRouting: databaseRouting));
```

|**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
|---|---|---|
| tenantId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | Your tenant ID. Also known as directory ID.|
| subscriptionId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The subscription ID that you use for resource creation.|
| clientId | *xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx* | The client ID of the application that can access resources in your tenant.|
| clientSecret | *PlaceholderClientSecret* | The client secret of the application that can access resources in your tenant. |
| resourceGroupName | *testrg* | The name of the resource group containing your cluster.|
| clusterName | *mykustocluster* | The name of your cluster.|
| databaseName | *mykustodatabase* | The name of the target database in your cluster.|
| dataConnectionName | *myeventhubconnect* | The desired name of your data connection.|
| tableName | *StormEvents* | The name of the target table in the target database.|
| mappingRuleName | *StormEvents_CSV_Mapping* | The name of your column mapping related to the target table.|
| dataFormat | *csv* | The data format of the message.|
| iotHubResourceId | *Resource ID* | The resource ID of your IoT hub that holds the data for ingestion. |
| sharedAccessPolicyName | *iothubforread* | The name of the shared access policy that defines the permissions for devices and services to connect to IoT Hub. |
| consumerGroup | *$Default* | The consumer group of your event hub.|
| location | *Central US* | The location of the data connection resource.|
| databaseRouting | *Multi* or *Single* | The database routing for the connection. If you set the value to **Single**, the data connection will be routed to a single database in the cluster as specified in the *databaseName* setting. If you set the value to **Multi**, you can override the default target database using the *Database* [ingestion property](ingest-data-iot-hub-overview.md#ingestion-properties). For more information, see [Events routing](ingest-data-iot-hub-overview.md#events-routing). |
