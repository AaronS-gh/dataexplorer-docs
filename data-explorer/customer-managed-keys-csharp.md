## Configure encryption with customer-managed keys

This section shows you how to configure customer-managed keys encryption using the Azure Data Explorer C# client. 

### Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2019, download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.
* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Install C# NuGet packages

* Install the [Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Kusto/).
* Install the [MSAL NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client/) for authentication with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

### Authentication

To run the examples in this article, [create an Azure AD application](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) and service principal that can access resources. You can add role assignment at the subscription scope and get the required `Azure AD Directory (tenant) ID`, `Application ID`, and `Application Secret`.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) to acquire an Azure AD application token to access your cluster. For this flow to succeed, the application must be registered with Azure AD and you must have the credentials for application authentication - Azure AD-issued application key or an Azure AD-registered X.509v2 certificate.

### Configure cluster

By default, Azure Data Explorer encryption uses Microsoft-managed keys. Configure your Azure Data Explorer cluster to use customer-managed keys and specify the key to associate with the cluster.

1. Update your cluster by using the following code:

    ```csharp
    var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";    // Azure AD Directory (tenant) ID
    var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";    // Application ID
    var clientSecret = "PlaceholderClientSecret";           // Application secret
    var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
    
    // Create a confidential authentication client for Azure AD:
    var authClient = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
            .WithAuthority($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}")
            .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)                 // can be replaced by .WithCertificate to authenticate with an X.509 certificate
            .Build();

    // Define scopes for accessing Azure management plane
    string[] scopes = new string[] { "https://management.core.windows.net/.default" };

    // Acquire application token
    AuthenticationResult result = authClient.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes).ExecuteAsync().Result;

    var credentials = new TokenCredentials(result.AccessToken, result.TokenType);
    var kustoManagementClient = new KustoManagementClient(credentials)
    {
        SubscriptionId = subscriptionId
    };

    var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
    var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
    var keyName = "myKey";
    var keyVersion = "5b52b20e8d8a42e6bd7527211ae32654"; // Optional, leave as NULL for the latest version of the key.
    var keyVaultUri = "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/";
    var keyVaultIdentity = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/identityResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/identityName"; // Use NULL if you want to use system assigned identity.
    var keyVaultProperties = new KeyVaultProperties(keyName, keyVaultUri, keyVersion, keyVaultIdentity);
    var clusterUpdate = new ClusterUpdate(keyVaultProperties: keyVaultProperties);
    await kustoManagementClient.Clusters.UpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, clusterName, clusterUpdate);
    ```

1. Run the following command to check if your cluster was successfully updated:

    ```csharp
    kustoManagementClient.Clusters.Get(resourceGroupName, clusterName);
    ```

    If the result contains `ProvisioningState` with the `Succeeded` value, then your cluster was successfully updated.

## Update the key version

When you create a new version of a key, you'll need to update the cluster to use the new version. First, call `Get-AzKeyVaultKey` to get the latest version of the key. Then update the cluster's key vault properties to use the new version of the key, as shown in [Configure cluster](#configure-cluster).
