# Customize Azure Data Explorer dashboard visuals

Visuals are essential part of any Azure Data Explorer Dashboard. This document details different visual types and how to customize these visuals.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have dashboard editing permissions to customize dashboards.

## Prerequisites

[Visualize data with Azure Data Explorer dashboards](azure-data-explorer-dashboards.md)

## Types of visuals

Azure Data Explorer supports several different types of visuals. This section describes the different types of visuals and the data columns needed in your result set to plot these visuals.

### Table

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/table.png" alt-text="table visual type.":::

By default, results are shown as a table. The table visual is best for presenting detailed or complicated data.

### Bar chart

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/bar-chart.png" alt-text="bar chart visual type.":::

The bar chart visual needs a minimum of two columns in the query result. By default, the first column is used as the y-axis. This column can contain text, datetime, or numeric data types. The other columns are used as the x-axis and contain numeric data types to be displayed as horizontal lines. Bar charts are used mainly for comparing numeric and nominal discrete values, where the length of each line represents its value.

### Column chart

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/column-chart.png" alt-text="column chart visual type.":::

The column chart visual needs a minimum of two columns in the query result. By default, the first column is used as the x-axis. This column can contain text, datetime, or numeric data types. The other columns are used as the y-axis and contain numeric data types to be displayed as vertical lines. Column charts are used for comparing specific sub category items in a main category range, where the length of each line represents its value.

### Area chart

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/area-chart.png" alt-text="area chart visual type.":::

The area chart visual shows a time-series relationship. The first column of the query should be numeric and is used as the x-axis. Other numeric columns are the y-axes. Unlike line charts, area charts also visually represent volume. Area charts are ideal for indicating the change among different data sets.

### Line chart

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/line-chart.png" alt-text="line chart visual type.":::

The line chart visual is the most basic type of chart. The first column of the query should be numeric and is used as the x-axis. Other numeric columns are the y-axes. Line charts track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller changes exist, line graphs are more useful than bar graphs.

### Stat

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/stat.png" alt-text="stat visual type.":::

The stat visual only shows one element. If there are multiple columns and rows in the output, stat shows the first element of the first column. Stat tiles are useful to highlight KPIs on the Dashboard.

### Multi stat

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/multistat.png" alt-text="multi stat visual type.":::

The multi stat visual shows multiple stat tiles in a group using a single query result. This requires two columns, one for the label and the other for the value. Users can use a visual formatting option to customize the output layout for display by selecting the number of rows and columns. In addition to being more convenient, this formatting option will reduce cluster load where customers are using similar queries to build multiple stats.

### Pie chart

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/pie-chart.png" alt-text="pie chart visual type.":::

The pie chart visual needs a minimum of two columns in the query result. By default, the first column is used as the color axis. This column can contain text, datetime, or numeric data types. Other columns will be used to determine the size of each slice and contain numeric data types. Pie charts are used for presenting a composition of categories and their proportions out of a total.

### Scatter chart

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/scatter-chart.png" alt-text="scatter chart visual type.":::

In a scatter chart visual, the first column is the x-axis and should be a numeric column. Other numeric columns are y-axes. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.

### Time chart 

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/time-chart.png" alt-text="time chart visual type.":::

A time chart visual is a type of line graph. the first column of the query is the x-axis, and should be datetime. Other numeric columns are y-axes. One string column values are used to group the numeric columns and create different lines in the chart. Other string columns are ignored. The time chart visual is similar to a [line chart](#line-chart) except the x-axis is always time.

### Anomaly chart 

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/anomaly-chart.png" alt-text="anomaly chart visual type.":::

An anomaly chart visual is similar to [time chart](#time-chart), but highlights anomalies using the `series_decompose_anomalies` function.

### Map

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/map.png" alt-text="map visual type.":::

To render the map visual, you must first select the type of location you're going to use.
Under **Define location by**, you can choose from the following options:

- Use two columns: Latitude and Longitude
- Use one column: Geospatial coordinates

In addition, you can specify the following options:

- Label column
- Size column: The integer values in this column are used to set the size of bubbles. The visual calculates the min and max values in the selected size column and then organizes sets the bubble size for all the other values in between.

Maps are useful to visualize data with geo coordinates. The Map visual also has a built-in zoom functionality.

### Funnel

:::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/funnel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the funnel map visual type.":::

To render the funnel visual, select a category column and value column.

Funnels are useful to visualize usage or acquisition data across different stages to evaluate the progress between one stage and the next one.

## Customize visuals

### Conditional formatting

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is supported for table, stat and multi stat visuals.

Conditional formatting is used to format the visual data points by their values using colors, tags, and icons.  Conditional formatting can be applied to a specific set of cells in a predetermined column or to entire rows.
Each visual can have one or more conditional formatting rules defined. When multiple rules conflict, the last rule will override previous rules.

1. Enter the editing mode of the table, stat, or multi stat visual you wish to conditionally format.
1. In the **Visual formatting** pane, scroll to the bottom and toggle **Conditional formatting** to **Show**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/add-conditional-formatting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding conditional formatting in dashboards in Azure Data Explorer web UI.":::

1. Select **Add rule**. A new rule appears with default values.

    :::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/edit-new-rule.png" alt-text="Screenshot of editing new rule in dashboards in Azure Data Explorer.":::

1. Select the **Edit** icon. The **Conditional formatting** pane opens. You can either [Color by condition](#color-by-condition) or [Color by value](#color-by-value).

#### Color by condition

1. In this example, we're going to create a rule that will color the cells of states in which the damage column is a value greater than zero. Enter the following information:

    :::image type="content" source="media/dashboard-customize-visuals/edit-conditional-formatting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of editing conditional formatting in dashboards in Azure Data Explorer web UI.":::

    Field | Description | Suggested value
    |---|---|---| 
    | Rule type | Condition-based rules or absolute value-based rules. | Color by condition
    | Rule name | Enter a name for this rule. If not defined, the condition column will be used by default. | Nonzero damage
    | Color style | Color formatting cell fill or text. |Bold
    | **Conditions** 
    | Column | The column to be used for the condition definition. |  Damage
    | Operator | The operator to be used to define the condition. | Greater than ">"
    | Value | The value to be compared to the condition. |
    |**Formatting**
    | Apply options | Apply the formatting to cells in a specific column or to the entire row. | Apply to cells
    | Column | The column on which the formatting is applied. By default, this column is the condition column. This option is only available when **Formatting: Apply options** is set to *Apply to cells*. | State
    | Hide text | Hides the text in the formatted column. This option is only available when **Formatting: Apply options** is set to *Apply to cells*. | Off
    | Color | The color to apply to the formatted column/rows. | Red
