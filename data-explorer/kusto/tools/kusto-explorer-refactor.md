# Kusto Explorer Code Refactoring

Similar to other IDEs, Kusto.Explorer offers several features to KQL query editing and refactoring.

## Rename variable or column name

Clicking `Ctrl`+`R`, `Ctrl`+`R` in the Query Editor window will allow you to rename currently selected symbol.

See below snapshot that demonstrates the experience:

## Extract scalars as `let` expressions

You can promote currently selected literal as `let` expression by clicking `Alt`+`Ctrl`+`M`.
