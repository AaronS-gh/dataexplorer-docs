# series_shapes_fl()

The function `series_shapes_fl()` detects positive/negative trend or jump in a series. This function takes a table containing multiple time series (dynamic numerical array), and calculates trend and jump scores for each series. The output is a dictionary (dynamic) containing the scores.

> [!NOTE]
> This function is a [UDF (user-defined function)](../query/functions/user-defined-functions.md). For more information, see [usage](#usage).

## Syntax

`T | extend series_shapes_fl(`*y_series*`,` *advanced*`)`

## Arguments

* *y_series*: Dynamic array cell of numeric values.
* *advanced*: Boolean flag, default to 'false'. Set to 'true' to output additional calculated parameters.

## Usage

`series_shapes_fl()` is a user-defined [tabular function](../query/functions/user-defined-functions.md#tabular-function), to be applied using the [invoke operator](../query/invokeoperator.md). You can either embed its code in your query, or install it in your database. There are two usage options: temporary and stored usage. See the below tabs for examples.

# [Temporary](#tab/temporary)

For temporary usage, embed its code using [let statement](../query/letstatement.md). No permission is required.

# [Stored](#tab/stored)

For persistent usage, use [`.create function`](../management/create-function.md). Creating a function requires [database user permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md).
