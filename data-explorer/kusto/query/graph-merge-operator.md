# graph-merge operator (Public Preview)

The `graph-merge` operator merges the nodes and edges of two graphs, combining them into a single new graph.

> [!WARNING]
> The `graph-merge` operator is currently offered in public preview mode. 
> The syntax and semantics of the operator might change prior to public availability.

## Syntax
*LeftGraph* | `graph-merge` (*RightGraph*) [on *Attributes*]

## Arguments
|Name|Type|Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|*LeftGraph*|Graph|Yes|The left graph. Denoted as `$left`|
|*RightGraph*|Graph|Yes|The right graph. Denoted as `$right`|
|*Attributes*|string|No|One or more comma-separated rules that describe how edges from *LeftGraph* are matched to edges from *RightGraph*. Multiple rules are evaluated using the `and` logical operator|


## Rules:
|Rule Kind|Syntax|Predicate|
|---|---|---|
|Equality by name| `ColumnName` | `where` `$left.ColumnName` == `$right.ColumnName` |
|Equality by value|`$left.LeftColumn` == `$right.RightColumn`| `where` `$left.LeftColumn` == `$right.RightColumn` |

## Returns
The graph merge operator combines nodes and edges from two origin graphs into a new graph, adhering to specified merge rules.
In the absence of any rules, the edges are unionized rather than merged.

## Examples
### Example 1:
The following example builds a graph from emails and aliases tables and a second graph for calls and employees first and last names. 
Following the `make-graph` operators that builds the two graphs is a call to `graph-merge`.
Because *Attributes* is not specified the edges of the new graph are the union of the edges from both the source graphs.

```kusto
let Emails = datatable(fromPrincipal: long, toPrincipal:long, wordCount: long, when: datetime) 
[
	1, 2, 200, datetime(2022, 01, 01),

	| make-graph caller --> callee with EmployeeInfo on principalId;

| graph-merge CallsGraph
| graph-to-table edges as MergeEdges, nodes as MergeNodes;

### Example 2:
The following example builds a graph from emails and aliases tables and a second graph for calls and employees first and last names. 
Following the `make-graph` operators that builds the two graphs is a call to `graph-merge`.
Because *Attributes* is specified the edges will be merged based on source and destination of the emails and calls (all edges with the same source and destination would be merged into a single edge).

```kusto
let Emails = datatable(fromPrincipal: long, toPrincipal:long, wordCount: long, when: datetime) 
[
	1, 2, 200, datetime(2022, 01, 01),
	2, 3, 500, datetime(2022, 01, 02),
