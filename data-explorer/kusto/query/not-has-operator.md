# !has operator

Filters a record set for data that doesn't have a matching case-insensitive string. `!has` searches for indexed terms, where an indexed [term](datatypes-string-operators.md#what-is-a-term) is three or more characters. If your term is fewer than three characters, the query scans the values in the column, which is slower than looking up the term in the term index.

## Performance tips

[!INCLUDE [performance-tip-note](../../includes/performance-tip-note.md)]

When possible, use [!has_cs](not-has-cs-operator.md) - a case-sensitive version of the operator.

## Syntax

*T* `|` `where` *Column* `!has` `(`*Expression*`)`

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *Column* - The column to filter.
* *Expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Example

```kusto
StormEvents
    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where State !has "NEW"
    | where event_count > 3000
    | project State, event_count
```

**Output**

|State|event_count|
|-----|-----------|
|TEXAS|4,701|
|KANSAS|3,166|
