# !hasprefix_cs operator

Filters a record set for data that doesn't have a case-sensitive starting string. `!hasprefix_cs` searches for indexed terms, where an indexed [term](datatypes-string-operators.md#what-is-a-term) is three or more characters. If your term is fewer than three characters, the query scans the values in the column, which is slower than looking up the term in the term index.

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`hasprefix`](hasprefix-operator.md) |RHS is a term prefix in LHS |No |`"North America" hasprefix "ame"`|
|[`!hasprefix`](not-hasprefix-operator.md) |RHS isn't a term prefix in LHS |No |`"North America" !hasprefix "mer"`|
|[`hasprefix_cs`](hasprefix-cs-operator.md) |RHS is a term prefix in LHS |Yes |`"North America" hasprefix_cs "Ame"`|
|[`!hasprefix_cs`](not-hasprefix-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't a term prefix in LHS |Yes |`"North America" !hasprefix_cs "CA"`|

> [!NOTE]
> The following abbreviations are used in the above table:
>
> * RHS = right hand side of the expression
> * LHS = left hand side of the expression
