# !contains_cs operator

Filters a record set for data that doesn't include a case-sensitive string. `contains` searches for characters rather than [terms](datatypes-string-operators.md#what-is-a-term) of three or more characters. The query scans the values in the column, which is slower than looking up a term in a term index.

[!INCLUDE [contains-operator-comparison](../../includes/contains-operator-comparison.md)]

## Performance tips

[!INCLUDE [performance-tip-note](../../includes/performance-tip-note.md)]

If you're looking for a [term](datatypes-string-operators.md#what-is-a-term), use `!has_cs` for faster results.

## Syntax

### Case-sensitive syntax

*T* `|` `where` *Column* `!contains_cs` `(`*Expression*`)`

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *Column* - The column to filter.
* *Expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.
