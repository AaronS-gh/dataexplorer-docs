# endswith_cs operator

Filters a record set for data with a case-sensitive ending string.

The following table provides a comparison of the `endswith` operators:

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`endswith`](endswith-operator.md) |RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" endswith "Kam"`|
|[`!endswith`](not-endswith-operator.md) |RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" !endswith "brik"`|
|[`endswith_cs`](endswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" endswith_cs "kam"`|
|[`!endswith_cs`](not-endswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" !endswith_cs "brik"`|

> [!NOTE]
> The following abbreviations are used in the table above:
>
> * RHS = right hand side of the expression
> * LHS = left hand side of the expression

For more information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](datatypes-string-operators.md).

## Performance tips

[!INCLUDE [performance-tip-note](../../includes/performance-tip-note.md)]

For faster results, use the case-sensitive version of an operator. For example, use `endswith_cs` instead of `endswith`.

## Syntax

*T* `|` `where` *col* `endswith_cs` `(`*expression*`)`

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *col* - The column to filter.
* *expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Example

```kusto
StormEvents
    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where State endswith_cs "IDA"
    | count
```

**Output**

|Count|

|1|
