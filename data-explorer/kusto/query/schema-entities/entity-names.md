# Entity names

Kusto entities are referenced in a query by name. Valid entity names include *databases*, *tables*, *columns*, and stored functions. *Clusters* can't be referenced by their names.

An entity's name is unique to the entity type in the context of its container. For example, two tables in the same database can't have the same name, but a database and a table can have the same name because they're different entity types. Similarly, a table and a stored function may have the same name.

> [!NOTE]
> Entity names that are also reflected as an [Azure resource](/azure/templates/microsoft.kusto/allversions) also follow the [ARM reserve words rules](/azure/azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/error-reserved-resource-name).

## Pretty names

In addition to the entity's name, some entities may have a **pretty name**. Similar to the use of entity names, pretty names can be used to reference an entity in queries. But unlike entity names, pretty names aren't necessarily unique in the context of their container. When a container has multiple entities with the same pretty name, the pretty name can't be used to reference the entity.

Pretty names allow middle-tier applications to map automatically created entity names (such as UUIDs) to names that are human-readable for display and referencing purposes.

## Identifier naming rules

An identifier is the name you assign to [entities](schema-entities.md), [query parameters](../queryparametersstatement.md), or a variable that is set through a [let statement](../letstatement.md). Valid identifiers must follow these rules:

* Identifiers must be between 1 and 1024 characters long.
* Identifiers may contain letters, digits, underscores (`_`), spaces, dots (`.`), and dashes (`-`).

> [!NOTE]
> The `$` character isn't allowed in stored entity names unless generated by a KQL operator.

### Avoid overlapping names between entities and Kusto Query Language keywords

In the Kusto Query Language, there are keywords that have similar naming rules as [identifiers](#identifier-naming-rules). It's possible to have entity names with the same name as keywords. To avoid using an identifier that might also be a KQL keyword, you can choose your entity name according to the following conventions, which aren't applicable to KQL keywords:

* Use a name that starts with a capital letter (`A` to `Z`).
* Use a name that starts with a single underscore (`_`).
* Use a name that ends with a single underscore (`_`).

> [!NOTE]
> The Kusto Query Language reserves all identifiers that start or end with a sequence of two underscore characters (`__`); users can't define such names for their own use.

### Referencing identifiers in queries

|Identifier   |Reference         |Explanation  |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
|`entity`     |`entity`          |Entity names (`entity`) that don't include special characters or map to some language keyword don't need to be enclosed in quotation marks.|
|`entity-name`|`['entity-name']` |Entity names that include special characters (here: `-`) must be enclosed in quotation marks: `['` and `']` or using `["` and `"]`.|
|`where`      |`["where"]`       |Entity names that are language keywords must be enclosed in quotation marks: `['` and `']` or `["` and `"]`.|

> [!NOTE]
> Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, you can't refer to a table called `ThisTable` as `thisTABLE`.
