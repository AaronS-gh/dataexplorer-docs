# Commands and queries management

## .show commands-and-queries 

`.show` `commands-and-queries` returns a table with admin commands and queries that have reached a final state. These commands and queries are available for 30 days.

The information presented in the output of the command is similar to [`.show` commands](commands.md) 
and [`.show` queries](queries.md), however it essentially lets you join both result sets in a simple manner.

**Syntax**

`.show` `commands-and-queries`
 
**Output**
 
The output schema is as follows:

| ColumnName               | ColumnType |
