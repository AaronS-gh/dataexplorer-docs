# Diagnostic information

These commands can be used to display system diagnostic information.

* [`.show capacity`](#show-capacity)
* [`.show operations`](#show-operations)

## .show capacity

```kusto
.show capacity [with(scope = cluster | workloadgroup)]
```

Returns the results of a calculation for an estimated cluster capacity for each resource.

`scope` controls the basis on which the capacities are shown. The capacity can be based on the [workload group](workload-groups.md) the command was classified to, or the cluster's total capacity. If unspecified, the default scope is `cluster`.

**Results**

|Output parameter |Type |Description|
|---|---|---|
|Resource |String |The name of the resource|
|Total |Int64 |The total amount of resources, of type 'Resource', that are available. For example, the number of concurrent ingestions|
|Consumed |Int64 |The amount of resources of type 'Resource' consumed right now|
|Remaining |Int64 |The amount of remaining resources of type 'Resource'|
|Origin |Int64 |The origin of the limit on concurrent requests ([capacity policy](capacitypolicy.md) or [request rate limit policy](request-rate-limit-policy.md))|

**Example**

|Resource |Total |Consumed |Remaining|Origin|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ingestions |576 |1 |575|CapacityPolicy/Ingestion|

## .show operations

This command returns a table containing all the administrative operations since the new Admin node was elected.

|Syntax option |Description|
|---|---|
|`.show` `operations`              |Returns all operations that the cluster is processing or have processed|
|`.show` `operations` *OperationId*|Returns the operation status for a specific ID|
|`.show` `operations` `(`*OperationId1*`,` *OperationId2*`,` ...)|Returns operations status for specific IDs|

**Results**

|Output parameter |Type |Description|
|---|---|---|
|ID |String |Operation identifier|
|Operation |String |Admin command alias|
|NodeId |String |If the command is running something remotely, such as DataIngestPull. The node ID will contain the ID of the remote node that is running|
|StartedOn |DateTime |Date/time (in UTC) when the operation started|
|LastUpdatedOn |DateTime |Date/time (in UTC) when the operation last updated. The operation can either be a step inside the operation, or a completion step|
|Duration |DateTime |Time span between LastUpdateOn and StartedOn|
|State |String |Command state, with values "InProgress", "Completed", or "Failed"|
|Status |String |Additional help string that contains the errors for failed operations|

**Example**

|ID |Operation |Node ID |Started On |Last Updated On |Duration |State |Status|
