# .delete ingestion time policy

Delete a table's [ingestion time policy](ingestiontimepolicy.md). Azure Data Explorer can add an optional policy for tables to create a hidden `datetime` column in the table, called `$IngestionTime`. Whenever new data is ingested, the time of ingestion is recorded in the hidden column. 

## Syntax

`.delete` `table` *TableName* `policy` `ingestiontime` 

### Example

```kusto
.delete table table_name policy ingestiontime 
```
