# .drop materialized-view 

Drops a materialized view.

Requires [Database Admin](../access-control/role-based-authorization.md) or materialized view admin permissions.

## Syntax

`.drop` `materialized-view` *MaterializedViewName* [`ifexists`]

> [!NOTE]
> If `ifexists` is specified, the command won't fail if it refers to a non-existent materialized view.

## Properties

| Property | Type| Description |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| MaterializedViewName| String| Name of the Materialized View.|

## Returns

The command returns the remaining materialized views in the database, which is the output of the [show materialized view](materialized-view-show-commands.md#show-materialized-view) command.

## Example

```kusto
.drop materialized-view ViewName
```
