# .delete table cache policy

Delete the table's cache policy. To speed up queries on data, Azure Data Explorer caches it on its processing nodes, SSD, or even in RAM. The [cache policy](cachepolicy.md) lets Azure Data Explorer describe the data artifacts that it uses so that important data can take priority.

## Permissions

You must have at least [Table Admin](access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.delete` `table` [*DatabaseName* `.`]*TableName* `policy` `caching`

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*DatabaseName*|string||The name of the database. Use when running outside the database context that contains the table for which to delete the cache policy.|
|*TableName*|string|&check;|The name of the table.|

## Example

The following example deletes the caching policy.

```kusto
.delete table MyTable policy 
```
