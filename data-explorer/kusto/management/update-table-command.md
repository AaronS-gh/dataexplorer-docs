# Update table

The `.update table` command performs transactional data updates in a specified table through the use of provided delete and append predicates. The delete and append predicates are provided by `let` statements.

## Permissions

You must have at least [Table Ingestor](../access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.

## Syntax

`.update` `table` *TableName* `delete` *DeleteIdentifier* `append` *AppendIdentifier* `<|`

`let` *DeleteIdentifier*`=` ...`;`

`let` *AppendIdentifier*`=` ...`;`

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*TableName*|string|&check;|The name of the table to update. The table name is always relative to the database in context. |
|*DeleteIdentifier*|string|&check;|The identifier name used to specify the delete predicate applied to the updated table.|
|*AppendIdentifier*|string|&check;|The identifier name used to specify the append predicate applied to the updated table.|

## Returns

The result of the command is a table with as many records
as there are data shards ("extents") generated by the command and deleted by the command.


|Name       |Type      |Description                                                                |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Table   |`guid`    |The table in which the extent was generated or deleted.|
|Action |`string`  |"Create" or "Delete" depending on the action performed on the extent.|
|ExtentId   |`guid`    |The unique identifier for the data shard that was generated or deleted by the command.|
|RowCount   |`long`    |The number of rows generated or deleted in the specified extent by the command.|

>[!NOTE]
> When you update a table that is the source for an update policy, the result of the command contains all generated results in all tables.

## Examples

The following example demonstrates how to update all records for a given user:
```
.update table T delete D append A <|
let D = T | where UserId == 'X';
let A = D | extend UserData = 'updated data';
```

## Limitations

- This command cannot be performed on tables which are the source tables to continuous exports and materialized views.
- This command does not support deleting more than 5 million records.
- The predicates for this command must meet the following requirements:
    - Delete predicate must include at least one `where` operator
    - Delete predicate can only use the following operators: `extend`, `where` and `project`.
    - No remote entities, cross-db and cross-cluster entities can be referenced by both the delete and append predicates.
    - The predicates cannot reference other tables, nor external tables and the `externaldata` operator.
- The delete predicate is expected to produce deterministic results and failing to do so can result in unexpected results.
