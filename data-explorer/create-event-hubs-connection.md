Azure Data Explorer offers ingestion from [Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about), which is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. Event Hubs can process millions of events per second in near real time.

In this article, you'll connect to an event hub and ingest data into Azure Data Explorer.

For information about ingesting from Event Hubs, see [Connect to event hub](ingest-data-event-hub-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md).
