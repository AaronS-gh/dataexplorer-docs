# Ingest data with Apache Flink into Azure Data Explorer

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data.

In this article, you learn how to use the Azure Data Explorer Flink connector to send data from Flink to a table in your Azure Data Explorer cluster. You create a table and data mapping, direct Flink to send data into the table, and then validate the results.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).
* An Apache Flink cluster. [Create a cluster](/azure/hdinsight-aks/flink/flink-create-cluster-portal).

## Create a table and a mapping object

## Install the Azure Data Explorer Flink connector

## Configure the connector to send data to Azure Data Explorer

## Verify that data is ingested into Azure Data Explorer
