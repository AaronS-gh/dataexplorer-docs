# Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster in your virtual network

Azure Data Explorer supports deploying a cluster into a subnet in your virtual network (VNet). This capability enables you to access the cluster privately from your Azure virtual network or on-premises, access resource such as event hub and storage inside your virtual network, and restrict inbound and outbound traffic.

> [!Note]
> Injecting a cluster into a virtual network enables you to manage all of its traffic. Therefore, you are responsible for ensuring that any connected services are able to communicate with each other, including Azure Event Hubs or Azure Storage accounts.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

## Create Virtual Network and subnet

To create the virtual network and subnet:

1. Select the **+ Create a resource** button in the upper-left corner of the portal.
1. Search for *Virtual Network*.
1. Under **Virtual Network**, at the bottom of the screen, select **Create**.
1. In the **Create virtual network** window, complete the following information.

    **Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**
    |---|---|---|
    | Subscription | Your subscription | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for your cluster.|
    | Resource group | Your resource group | Use an existing resource group or create a new resource group. |
    | Name | AzureDataExplorerVnet | Choose a name that identifies your virtual network in the resource group.
    | Region | *West US* | Select the region that best meets your needs.
    | | | |

    > [!NOTE]
    > For production workloads, plan your subnet size according to [plan subnet size in your VNet](vnet-deployment.md#plan-subnet-size-in-your-vnet)

1. Select **Review + create** to review your cluster details, and **Create** to provision the cluster.

1. When the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.
1. Go to **Subnets** blade and select the **default** subnet.

1. In your **default** subnet window:
    1. Select **Microsoft.Kusto/clusters** from the subnet delegation drop-down menu.
    1. Select **Save**.

## Create a cluster

Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster with a defined set of compute and storage resources in an Azure resource group as described in [create a cluster](create-cluster-database-portal.md#create-a-cluster).

1. Prior to finalizing cluster creation, in the **Create an Azure Data Explorer cluster** window, select the **Network** tab to provide virtual network details using the resources created in the previous tabs:

   ![Create cluster vnet form.](media/vnet-create-cluster-portal/create-cluster-form-vnet.png)

    **Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**
    |---|---|---|
    | Subscription | Your subscription | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for networking resources.|
    | Virtual Network | AzureDataExplorerVnet | Choose the virtual network created in the previous steps.
    | Subnet | default | Choose the subnet created in the previous steps.

1. Create Query Public IP:
    1. Select **Create new**
    1. In **Create Public IP** window, provide the following details:
    
    ![Create cluster vnet form public IP.](media/vnet-create-cluster-portal/vnet-create-public-ip.png)

    | **Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description** |
    |---|---|---|
    | Name | Engine-public-ip | The name of the public ip address resource.|
    | Resource group | Your resource group | Select the resource group that you want to use for creating public IP.|

1. Do the same steps for **Data ingestion Public IP**
1. Select **Review + create** to create your cluster.
1. When the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

To deploy your Azure Data Explorer cluster into your virtual network, use the [Deploy Azure Data Explorer cluster into your VNet](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/kusto-vnet/) Azure Resource Manager template.
